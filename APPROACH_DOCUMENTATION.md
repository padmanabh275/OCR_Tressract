# AI/ML Document Information Extraction System

## Overview

This document outlines the approach, implementation, and capabilities of an AI/ML system designed to extract structured information from various document types including personal identification, financial records, and proof of address documents.

## Problem Statement

The system addresses the challenge of automatically extracting key information from unstructured documents such as:
- Personal Identification (driver's license, passport, birth certificate)
- Social Security Number documents
- Proof of Address (utility bills, rental agreements, government-issued IDs)
- Financial Information (tax returns, W-2 forms, bank statements)

## Target Fields for Extraction

The system is designed to extract the following structured information:
- **Date of Birth**: Birth date from various document formats
- **Marriage Date**: Wedding or marriage date when available
- **Legal First Name and Last Name**: Full legal names
- **Birth City**: Place of birth information
- **SSN**: Social Security Numbers (with proper formatting)
- **Current Valid Address**: Current residential or mailing address
- **Financial Data**: Income, tax information, and financial records for the last 3 years

## Technical Approach

### 1. Multi-Modal Document Processing

The system employs a hybrid approach combining:
- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**: Using Tesseract for image-based documents
- **Direct Text Extraction**: For PDF documents using PyMuPDF
- **Image Preprocessing**: OpenCV-based enhancement for better OCR accuracy

### 2. Natural Language Processing

- **spaCy Integration**: For advanced named entity recognition (NER)
- **Regex Patterns**: Fallback patterns for robust text extraction
- **Date Parsing**: Intelligent date extraction and validation using dateutil

### 3. Document Classification

The system automatically classifies documents into categories:
- Driver's License
- Passport
- Birth Certificate
- SSN Documents
- Utility Bills
- Rental Agreements
- Tax Returns
- W-2 Forms
- Bank Statements

### 4. Information Extraction Pipeline

```
Document Input → Preprocessing → Text Extraction → Field Extraction → Validation → Structured Output
```
