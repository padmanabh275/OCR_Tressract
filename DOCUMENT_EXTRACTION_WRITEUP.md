# AI/ML Document Information Extraction System
## Technical Write-up and Implementation Report

### Executive Summary

This document presents a comprehensive AI/ML system for extracting structured information from various document types including personal identification, financial records, and proof of address documents. The system successfully extracts critical fields such as names, dates, addresses, SSNs, and financial data with high accuracy and confidence scoring.

## 1. System Architecture and Approach

### 1.1 Multi-Stage Extraction Pipeline

The system employs a sophisticated three-stage extraction pipeline:

**Stage 1: Document Preprocessing**
- Multiple image enhancement techniques (Gaussian blur, adaptive thresholding, contrast enhancement)
- PDF text extraction using PyMuPDF for native text content
- Image preprocessing for optimal OCR performance

**Stage 2: Text Extraction**
- Tesseract OCR with multiple PSM (Page Segmentation Mode) configurations
- Fallback mechanisms for different document layouts
- Confidence scoring for each extraction method

**Stage 3: Information Extraction**
- Advanced regex pattern matching for structured data
- Document type classification using weighted keyword scoring
- Data validation and cleaning with format standardization

### 1.2 Document Type Classification

The system classifies documents into 9 categories using a weighted keyword scoring algorithm:
- Personal Identification (driver's license, passport, birth certificate)
- SSN Documents
- Proof of Address (utility bills, rental agreements)
- Financial Information (tax returns, W-2 forms, bank statements)

Each document type has specific extraction patterns and validation rules tailored to its format and content structure.

## 2. Technical Implementation

### 2.1 Core Libraries and Frameworks

**OCR and Image Processing:**
- **Tesseract OCR**: Multi-language text recognition with configurable PSM modes
- **OpenCV**: Advanced image preprocessing and enhancement
- **PIL (Pillow)**: Image manipulation and format conversion
- **PyMuPDF (fitz)**: PDF text extraction and image processing

**Web Application:**
- **FastAPI**: High-performance async web framework for API endpoints
- **React**: Modern frontend with drag-and-drop interface
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database for data persistence
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and serialization

**Machine Learning and NLP:**
- **spaCy**: Optional natural language processing for advanced text analysis
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis (optional)
- **python-dateutil**: Advanced date parsing and validation

### 2.2 Data Extraction Patterns

**Regex Pattern Library:**
```python
patterns = {
    'ssn': [r'\b\d{3}-?\d{2}-?\d{4}\b', r'\b\d{9}\b'],
    'date_of_birth': [r'(?:DOB|Date of Birth)[:\s]*(\d{1,2}[/-]\d{1,2}[/-]\d{2,4})'],
    'name': [r'(?:Name|Full Name)[:\s]*([A-Za-z\s]+)'],
    'address': [r'\d+\s+[A-Za-z0-9\s,.-]+(?:Street|St|Avenue|Ave)']
}
```

**Confidence Scoring Algorithm:**
- Document type classification confidence (0-1.0)
- Field extraction success rate (0-1.0)
- Pattern matching strength (0-1.0)
- Overall confidence = weighted average of all factors

### 2.3 Database Schema

**Documents Table:**
- Document metadata (ID, filename, type, confidence, timestamps)
- File information (size, path, processing time)

**Extracted Fields Table:**
- Structured field storage (first_name, last_name, SSN, etc.)
- Field-level validation and confidence scores

**Financial Data Table:**
- Specialized storage for financial information
- Support for multi-year financial data extraction
